Couple things about my program:
Since I wrote in Java, I exported my program as a runnable jar file, named as Othello.jar, you could just click on it, and you will be able to play just following the menu options. You will be able to click on the buttons in the either throughout P vs P mode or only your turn in the P vs AI mode, but limited to the legal moves only. If there is no legal move, you will either click on “pass” button, or the system will automatically move on after the time interval that you specify at the beginning. I show legal moves in red for black player, and in yellow for white player. As for the AI vs AI mode, clicking buttons will do thing to the game.

However, I notices that there might be few times you might see both yellow and red stones on the board, but if you click on any empty button, then you will see correct display. Same thing happened in other modes during my testing, it was strange to me since the values associated with each square are correct, but just the display sometimes messes up.
